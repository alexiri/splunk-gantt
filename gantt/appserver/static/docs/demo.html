This gantt chart visualization is a good way to present transactions or sessions on different resources. 
The data will be split vertically into different categories (the resources), and will be colored 
according to the series (users, in the previous example).

<p>The visualization can be configured through the following parameters:
<ul>
    <li><code>startField</code>: the field of your search that represents the start of the transaction.</li>
    <li><code>endField</code>: the field of your search that represents the end of the transaction.</li>
    <li><code>durationField</code>: the field of your search that represents the length of the transaction.</li>
    <li><code>categoryLabel</code>: label for categories. Default is 'Category'.</li>
    <li><code>categoryField</code>: field that represents the categories.</li>
    <li><code>categorySearch</code>: search to seed the list of categories.</li>
    <li><code>seriesLabel</code>: label for the series. Default is 'Series'.</li>
    <li><code>seriesField</code>: field that represents the series.</li>
    <li><code>drilldownField</code>: field to use for drilldowns (if not specified, drilldown by time).</li>
    <li><code>drilldownSearch</code>: use this search instead of the automatically-generated drilldown search.</li>
    <li><code>highlightField</code>: field to use for highlighting when putting the mouse over the data (if not specified, only highlight the series label in the legend).</li>
    <li><code>showLegend</code>: if 'true', displays the series under the chart as a legend. Default is 'true'.</li>
    <li><code>compact</code>: if 'true', makes the bars thinner in order to fit more of them. This is particularly useful when there are many concurrent tasks or categories. Default is 'false'.</li>
    <li><code>extrasField</code>: field that represents any extra information you want displayed in the tooltip. This field can be standard text or a JSON object (such as <code>eval extras="{\"Source Type\": \""+sourcetype+"\", \"Host\": \""+host+"\"}"</code>, note the use of double quotes, which must be properly escaped if defined inside the .xml). The keys of the JSON object will be the labels of the values in the tooltip. You can include HTML in the field, but please use this wisely.</li>
    <li><code>timeAxisMode</code>: if 'DATA_RANGE', the x-axis time range is only from the earliest start time in the data to the latest end time in the data.  Default is 'SEARCH_RANGE', where the x-axis time range covers from the 'earliest_time' in the search criteria to the 'latest_time' in the search criteria.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Note that any two of <code>startField</code>, <code>endField</code> or <code>durationField</code> 
must be defined. If all three are defined, <code>durationField</code> is ignored. If only two are 
defined, the missing field is calculated based on the values of the other two.</p>

<p>If you aren't seeing the events you expect on your graph, check the javascript console of your browser: there may be warnings about events that couldn't be formatted that may help you solve the problem.</p>

<p>Avoid using too many different values for the series. First of all, because the chart will be too
busy and confusing, but also because the legend's colors will start to repeat. Currently, there are a
maximum of 20 different colors.<p>

<p>The optional field <code>categorySearch</code> should contain a search to be executed that produces a list of categories
that will be added to the ones obtained from the search results, should they not be present. This is useful, for example,
when you have a list of resources and some of them may be missing in the results. In that case, your search may look like:
<code>| inputlookup resourcelist</code>. Note that searches must start with the keyword <code>search</code> or a pipe character.</p>

<p>The optional field <code>drilldownSearch</code> should contain the search to use instead of the
automatically-generated drilldown searches. You can use tokens in your search, just like you would do in a dashboard.
The values for those tokens will be filled in based on what item you clicked on. For example: <code>search index=_internal sourcetype=$sourcetype$ host=$host$</code>. Beware of multi-valued fields, they'll be substituted joined by a comma (ie. <code>mymv="$mymv$"</code> becomes <code>mymv="value1,value2"</code>).</p>

<h3>Adding a Gantt chart to your dashboard</h3>
How to integrate this custom visualization into your deployment and/or app:
<ol>
    <li>Load the following <code>autodiscover.js</code> into your app's appserver/static directory. You may rename it to <code>dashboard.js</code> (or add it to said file, if you already have one). You can also keep it as <code>autodiscover.js</code>, but then you will have to include it in each dashboard as shown below.</li>
    <li>If you don't want to have this app installed, copy all required source files to your app. You can find these in <code>$SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/gantt/appserver/static/components/gantt/</code></li>
    <li>Add an html element to your simple xml dashboard</li>
    <li>Use similar <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> tags to instantiate your custom viz, as well as the search to drive it
    <ul>
        <li>Note that you must bind the custom viz to the search manager, denoted by <code>"managerid"</code></li>
        <li>The "managerid" is bound to the "id" of the searchmanager in the following example</li>
        <li>Also make sure to reference the correct path to your custom viz source files (<code>data-require</code>)</li>
        <li>For additional information on using the splunkjs searchmanager, please refer to the Splunk Web Framework Reference Manual</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Use a search that provides a start time, end time and/or duration, such as a transaction or a log message 
describing the completion of an operation and how long it took. In the case of transactions that last longer
than the end of your search, you can calculate a duration using the info_max_time of the search 
(<code>... | transaction ... | addinfo | eval duration=if(eventcount=1, info_max_time-_time, duration) | ...</code>).</li>
    <li>Figure out what constitutes categories and series in your case. For example, resources and users, schedules and servers, etc. Categories will be drawn on the left-hand side and the series will define the colors of the bars.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Using forms with Gantt charts</h3>
If you add a timepicker (for example) to a dashboard with a gantt chart, don't forget to change 
the time selectors to your search, as follows:

<ul>
    <li><code>"earliest_time": { "type": "token_safe", "value": "$$earliest$$" },</code></li>
    <li><code>"latest_time": { "type": "token_safe", "value": "$$latest$$" },</code></li>
</ul>
